The goal is providing better house renting service with blockchain.
In the project, I explained the principle of blockchain to our team members from the perspective of information security, and how it works for the HouseChain project, which I output Housechain.jpg.
And, we also will leverage this capability to build a new house renting application based on [hyperleger/Fabric](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Archive/learn-chaincode)
