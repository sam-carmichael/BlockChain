# BlockChain

Project 1: HouseChain
The project is our entry in 2016 Winter Borathon of VMware,
The goal is providing better house renting service with blockchain.
In the project, I explained the principle of blockchain to our team members from the perspective of information security, and how it works for the HouseChain project.
